# A Framework for System Design Interviews

system design interviews are not only a way to show your technical skills and knowledge, but also to give the interviewer a sense of your ability to communicate, collaborate, and speak/think through real-life problems, on a smaller and simpler scale

## Step 1: Understand the problem and design scope

* ask lots and lots of questions
  * what platform(s) is the app on? how many users? tech stack? target audience? specific features?
* get a sense of what kind of skills or problems the interviewer wants to focus on for the hour
* deeply understand the context, any necessary assumptions (written down), and a general idea of the end goal

## Step 2: High-level design 
* ONLY after understanding the problem and for what we're designing
* high-level blueprint of design: box diagram, basic architecture & connections
* back-of-the-envelope calculations, early identification of bottlenecks, etc.

## Step 3: Design deep dive
* ONLY after you and your interviewer agree on a high-level blueprint
* focus on 1-3 key components in the design (clarify whether the interviewer wants to focus on any particular ones)

## Step 4: Wrap up
* recap of designs (especially any solutions you may have suggested)
* look for any edge cases or error cases in the design
* discuss any potential improvements
* discuss opportunities for better scaling, operational issues, etc.
* ask if there are any other clarifying questions from the interviewer 

## General tips
* the interviewer is your friend, and (hopefully) wants to join in on the problem solving process
* use your interviewer for bouncing off ideas, asking clarifying questions, asking for hints, etc.
* time allocation is essential
  * don't get bogged down in minute details that aren't productive or don't show off your skills
  * design deep dive and high-level design are the most important parts
* talk through everything, make sure you communicate all ideas with the interviewer to show your problem-solving process
